### About

- The goal of the project is to identify 7 key human emotions: HAPPY, NEUTRAL, SAD, SURPRISE, ANGER, DISGUST and FEAR, the project uses FER2013 dataset to train a classification Convolutional neural networks (CNN) model which takes a grayscale images of faces and predicts the most probable emotion in the output layer. The trained model was then used as the baseline to classify a facial emotion in the real-time application which was implemented using OpenCV, we extract the detected face from image frames in a real-time video then offer it to the model to predict and print the emotion in real-time.
